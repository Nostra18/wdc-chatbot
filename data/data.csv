The report highlighted a signicant decline in crop yields, with a drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23. Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement. The 2022/23 cropping season experienced low and highly erratic rainfall, along with extended dry periods, severely impacting food and agricultural production, disrupting urban water supplies, and damaging the rural economy and socio-cultural structures. As a result, the nation is experiencing signicant chronic food insecurity, with over 10% of the population facing food and nutrition problems.
The country has experienced dry spells and rainfall decits in recent years, leading the government to declare a drought emergency in July 2023. This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people have been categorized as food insecure. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that 37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity in 2024.
The El Niño drought effect in Southern Africa has further exacerbated the already critical drought situation.

The continuous crop failures over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hands, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity. Approximately, 325,000 individuals are experiencing the ramifications of the ongoing food insecurity based on IPC information, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately 22% of the population. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohale’s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas.

Taking into account the speed at which the worms spread, it is highly likely that other neighbouring provinces, especially Nord-Kivu, Ituri, Maniema and Kasai, are already affected. The extent of the spread would result in a significant impact on the local corn production (FEWSNET 28/02/2017).(ACAPS, 23 Mar 2017)
As of August 2017, the spread of fall armyworms has destroyed crops in 50 out of the country’s 145 territories. Between 50 to 80 percent of people in some of the areas affected by hunger struggle to make ends meet and to have something to eat. (WFP, FAO, 14 Aug 2017)
The number of acutely food insecure people from June to December 2017 has risen by almost 2 million since the same period in 2016. Conflict is causing widespread insecurity and population displacements in North Kivu, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika, Haut-Katanga and Kasai provinces. As of October 2017, 3.9 million people were internally displaced, more than 1.3 million in Kasai. Many people are eating little more than a meal a day – typically just maize or cassava root and leaves. Crops have been destroyed, production areas and market routes cut off, huge numbers of farmers displaced and planting areas severely reduced. Crop production has been affected by pest attacks such as the Fall Armyworm, which has a ected more than 80 territories. The depreciation of the local currency has resulted in more expensive and reduced imports. This, combined with limited domestic food supplies, has pushed up cereal prices. (FAO, 16 Jan 2018)
Conflict related reduction in area planted as well as destruction from the Fall Army Worm (FAW) infestation are expected to contribute towards below average 2017 crop. Both factors will likely remain relevant through the early part of 2018 and consequently result in weak expectations for 2018 harvests. (FEWS, 31 Jan 2018)"

In all, nearly 2.5 million people were affected, losing their families, their homes, and their means of making even a meagre living. All these people already were vulnerable, with many of them chronically poor, subject to wide inequalities within their own societies, displacement, environmental issues from over fishing and deforestation, human rights violations, and longstanding armed conflicts. Households headed by women particularly were pushed deeper into poverty. When the tsunami was finished, it was the most destructive disaster of its kind in history.

The year 2004 was no different: two confirmed and 20 suspected cases of cholera  occurred in Lusakam,13 cases in Sinazongwe; of these, two patients died.

The outbreaks occurred in poor, high-density, peri-urban areas with unsafe water supplies, inadequate sanitation and poor hygienic conditions, and the rains exacerbated these conditions and sparked the outbreak. Thanks to joint efforts by the Government and its partners, proactive measures to prevent recurring outbreaks were taken.  (IFRC, 25 Nov 2004)"

Mean rainfall between 1 to 6 December averaged 300 - 500 mm in Thua Thien Hue province, 600-1000 mm in Quang Ngai, Quang Nam, Da Nang and Khanh Hoa provinces, and in some parts of Quang Ngai and Quang Nam rainfall averaged as much as 2000 mm. The rains caused flash floods in mountainous areas. Notably the Tra Khuc River in Quang Ngai reached levels unsurpassed since 1964 (alarm level III), and river levels in Quang Ngai and Khanh Hoa were higher than any recorded for these provinces over the last 40 years. Since 6 December rainfall has diminished and water levels in rivers flowing through Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Da Nang and Binh Dinh are now fluctuating around alarm level III, while in the other affected provinces they have descended to alarm level II and below. However, the coastal delta areas of Quang Nam, Quang Ngai and Binh Dinh are still seriously flooded. Details of flooding and inundation in the central provinces are as follows: Quang Nam Province: the provincial capital and four other districts are under water. Hundreds of houses are flooded and tens of thousands of people cannot return to their homes. Evacuees are in need of food, medicine and other basic items. Quang Ngai Province: 15 communes situated in delta districts and 58 communes in mountainous districts are inaccessible to relief workers.

The earthquake was centered at latitude 16.4 South and longitude 168.2 East. The island, which has a population of about 12,000 and is about 63 km long and 12 km wide, was the worst hit area. The earthquake was followed within fifteen minutes by a tsunami that swept ashore at Marteli Bay on the southern tip of the island. The tidal wave reportedly reached about 2 kilometres into the bush. The earthquake was felt in Port Vila, 450 km to the south. Minor damage has also occurred on the islands of Ambrym, Malekula and Epi. [...] The effects of the earthquake across Pentecost appear to be relatively localised. Eight fatalities have been reported; five persons died when their house collapsed in the central village of Ena; three others died after being swept out to sea by the tsunami. A further two are missing. About 40 serious injuries were also reported, particularly at Ena village, Melsisi Mission, Ranwadi High School, and the nearby areas. [...] The tsunami at Marteli Bay has flattened all low-lying structures including the brick schoolhouse, leaving only the church still standing. It destroyed the piped water supply, caused loss of all public and private possessions in the community including 7 boats and 4 generators, and covered gardens in silt. [...] Pentecost's already pre-existing access problems are now significantly worsened due to landslides. Several slopes are clearly unstable, posing a threat in the next heavy rainfall to people directly in their path, and cutting access to essential services for many more. Water supply has also been affected, as wells have caved in, water catchments affected, and some water tanks were toppled, though these should be capable of repair. (OCHA, 30 Nov 1999)"

The areas concerned are 11 provinces in the North, 17 provinces in the North-East, 9 provinces in the Central Plains, 6 provinces in the East, and 1 province in the South. News reports hold that fears of drought have been averted in some provinces in the East and in the lower Central Plains owing to the downpour that drenched them on 28 January and did not let up for days. Taking into consideration the record low water levels in Thailand's other major dams and reservoirs, Thai people will undoubtedly face severe drought in 1999. Water shortages have already hit many provinces as mentioned above. The drought situation could worsen during February to June this year. People have been urged to make careful use of the limited water supply. In particular, farmers have been urged to respond to the impending water crisis by reducing their planting acreage for the second rice crop as a means to saving water. As part of a water rationing scheme The Royal Irrigation Department has discouraged farmers from planting a second rice crop this season and urged them to plant short-lived crops which consume less water, in the interim. The department of Livestock Development will also advise farmers to turn from second rice crop cultivation to poultry farming. The above reported drought situation in Thailand unfortunately coincides with a difficult time of economic recession. Thailand must attach greater importance than before to agricultural production if there is to be a move towards economic recovery. Indeed, the agricultural sector should ideally act as a source of employment to workers laid off from industry, yet the coming of the drought can only weaken agriculture's role in improving the overall economy.

Prior to the eruption, on July 16, 1990, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake (comparable in size to the great 1906 San Francisco, California, earthquake) struck about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northeast of Mount Pinatubo on the island of Luzon in the Philippines, shaking and squeezing the Earth's crust beneath the volcano. At Mount Pinatubo, this major earthquake caused a landslide, some local earthquakes, and a short-lived increase in steam emissions from a preexisting geothermal area, but otherwise the volcano seemed to be continuing its 500-year-old slumber undisturbed. In March and April 1991, however, molten rock (magma) rising toward the surface from more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) beneath Pinatubo triggered small earthquakes and caused powerful steam explosions that blasted three craters on the north flank of the volcano. Thousands of small earthquakes occurred beneath Pinatubo through April, May, and early June, and many thousand tons of noxious sulfur dioxide gas were also emitted by the volcano. (USGS, 28 Feb 2005) The consequences of these eruptions were aggravated by a tropical storm and four earth tremors (the first one of magnitude 3 on Richter scale) affecting the Northern Philippines around the volcano area on 15 June.
